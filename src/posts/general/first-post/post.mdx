After 7 months of learning the technologies necessary to begin my career as a web developer, I thought it appropriate to start logging my journey. Not only as a reference to myself of my growth as a developer but to others who I hope to eventually inspire to also take the same leap.

I should probably start by introducing myself. My name is Hunter Thacker. I was born and raised in Louisville KY to a middle-class family. I've always been interested in Art and Technology. Though the two different subjects in my life were usually kept apart, I always imagined that one day I would bring them together into one.

Having spent the better part of my childhood immersed within my own imagination. I couldn't help myself but to always create and put forth my ideas into the world. This desire has stuck with me throughout my life and I have often found myself expressing my artistic visions with almost everything that I do now.

At the age of 9 or so, I inherited my first computer. An old Dell that ran on windows 98. This thing was clunky and loud, and as you'd probably expect extremely slow. 9 year old me would spend the first 15 or so minutes when booting it up just to clear on the task manager of any tasks that I at the time perceived to be useless or cluttering. I made this work as I really didn't have a choice otherwise, but as my knowledge of computers grew so did my desire for something a little more up to date and fast.

By the time I was about 12, I found some much better hand-me-down parts and built what I considered to be my first "real" computer. It ran on Windows Vista. Definitely a huge improvement over my late Windows 98 rig. This computer was the sandbox for which I began to really explore the world of computer science. Files Structures and the command prompt.

Being an avid gamer growing up I was fascinated by the idea of hosting my own dedicated Minecraft server. This was at the time, a huge feat of accomplishment for my 12-year-old self. I downloaded the base files I needed. Messed around with some of the code and installed plugins. I found a way to monetize it and even made a little bit of money. Little did I know this would be a snapshot of my future self playing around with npm packages, nodeJS, and creating web applications.

Fast forward to March 2020. Covid-19 has made its way to the United States and subsequently Louisville KY. I was at this time waiting tables unaware that I was about to be permanently furloughed. This was the first stepping stone on my journey as a Web Developer.

As lockdown came and went, and with the newfound surplus of time I had on my hands. I realized then that there was no better time to start this journey. In a post-Covid-19 world, it has become more apparent that having a strong internet presence will be more important now than ever.

I bought a Udemy course: Colt Steele's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. A course that builds up from HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the front end to Back End technologies like NodeJS, NPM, Restful Routing, API calls, and HTTP requests. This course took about 3 months to complete and through it learned everything I needed to know to build and launch responsive web applications.

I'm comfortable working with HTML, CSS, Javascript as well as libraries like TailwindCSS, BootStrapCSS, and MaterialUI. I also work with frameworks like ReactJS and GatsbyJS which this website happens to be built on.

This blog represents my transition from learning to working in my career as a web developer. I plan to keep learning new technologies and to keep you all updated on my journey.
